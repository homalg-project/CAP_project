  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YTerminology[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe compiler is a just-in-time compiler, that is, it needs some arguments to
  infer  types  of variables. These arguments are refered to as [13XJIT arguments[113X.
  For a given CAP operation, these are usually the arguments of the first call
  of the operation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe compiler uses GAP's syntax trees for optimizing functions. The term [13Xtree[113X
  always refers to the syntax tree of the function to be compiled. Note that a
  node  of  the  tree  always  knows its children, so technically it is also a
  tree.  That  is,  the terms [13Xtree[113X, [13Xsubtree[113X, and [13Xnode[113X technically describe the
  same thing but we use them for different emphases.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe often replace a node in the tree by another tree representing the "value"
  of the original node. Examples:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YReplace  a  global  variable  referencing  an  integer, a string, or a
        boolean by EXPR_INT, EXPR_STRING, EXPR_TRUE or EXPR_FALSE.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YReplace  a  global variable referencing a plain function by the syntax
        tree of this function.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YReplace  a  record  access  of  a global function by the value of this
        record access.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YReplace an operation by a concrete method.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  call  this [13Xresolving[113X the global variable, operation, etc. Note that this
  does not change the basic "layout" of the tree.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOn  the  contrary,  in  the following examples we change the "layout" of the
  tree:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  we  have a function call of a resolved function, we can assign the
        argument  values  to local variables at the beginning of the function.
        This way we can avoid passing arguments completely.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  a  function  call  of a resolved function occurs in the right hand
        side  of a variable assignment, we can insert the body of the resolved
        function  right  before the variable assignment. This way we can avoid
        the function call.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWe  can  replace  all references to a local variable by the right hand
        side of the variable assignment and then drop the assignment.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  call  this  [13Xinlining[113X  the  function  arguments,  functions,  or variable
  assignments.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YCapabilities of the compiler[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  compilation  process  has  two phases: the resolving phase and the rule
  phase.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDuring the resolving phase, operations and global variables are resolved:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAn operation is resolved by executing the function to be compiled with
        the  JIT  arguments to determine the arguments of the operation. These
        arguments  are  used  to  call [10XApplicableMethod[110X, and methods annotated
        with  the  pragma  [10XCAP_JIT_RESOLVE_FUNCTION[110X are resolved. This step is
        skipped       if       the       operation      is      listed      in
        [10XCAP_JIT_NON_RESOLVABLE_OPERATION_NAMES[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YCAP    operations   are   handled   separately:   instead   of   using
        [10XApplicableMethod[110X,   the  functions  added  to  the  category  via  [10XAdd[110X
        functions  are  considered, and those do not have to be annotated with
        [10XCAP_JIT_RESOLVE_FUNCTION[110X.  In particular, caching, pre functions, etc.
        are bypassed.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YYou     can     also     use     [10XInstallMethodForCompilerForCAP[110X     or
        [10XInstallOtherMethodForCompilerForCAP[110X  (see the documentation of CAP) to
        make methods known to the compiler. These methods are resolved via the
        number   of   arguments   and   do  not  have  to  be  annotated  with
        [10XCAP_JIT_RESOLVE_FUNCTION[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YReferences  to  global  functions are resolved if the function name is
        not  listed in [10XCAP_JIT_NON_RESOLVABLE_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_NAMES[110X and if the
        function is annotated with the pragma [10XCAP_JIT_RESOLVE_FUNCTION[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  a  call  of  a global function or operation (occuring as the right
        hand  side  of  a  variable  assignment  or  as  the return value of a
        function)        is        annotated       with       the       pragma
        [10XCAP_JIT_NEXT_FUNCCALL_DOES_NOT_RETURN_FAIL[110X,  the compiler assumes that
        the  resolved  function never returns [10Xfail[110X and thus simply removes any
        code  of the form [10Xif condition then return fail; fi;[110X (or similar) from
        the  resolved  function.  The pragma has to be placed right before the
        variable assignment or the return statement.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  the  pragma  [10XCAP_JIT_DROP_NEXT_STATEMENT[110X  occurs  in  the resolved
        function, the statement following the pragma is removed.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf a KeyDependentOperation is detected, the corresponding [10XOp[110X method is
        resolved.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor      details      see      [2XCapJitResolvedOperations[102X     ([14X2.5-17[114X)     and
  [2XCapJitResolvedGlobalVariables[102X  ([14X2.5-16[114X).  If no operation or global variable
  can be resolved anymore, we continue with the rule phase.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn the rule phase, the tree is optimized using several rules and techniques.
  Function  arguments,  functions,  and  assignments  to  local  variables are
  inlined.  Unused variables are dropped. Handled edge cases are dropped, that
  is,  if  the  same  edge case is caught multiple times via [10Xif condition then
  return  ...; fi;[110X statements, only the first such statement is kept. Finally,
  "logic"  is  applied  to  the  tree.  For example, calls of [10XCallFuncList[110X are
  replaced  by  calls to the actual function. The logic can be extended by the
  user, see chapter [14X2[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor all details, see the list of compilations steps in [14X2.5[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YRequirements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere are two main requirements for the steps described above to be correct:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  code must not depend on side effects (otherwise dropping "unused"
        variables or inlining variables could change results).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  methods  selected  for  the operations during the resolving phase
        must  be  independent  of  the JIT arguments, that is, they must yield
        correct  results  for  all  allowed  arguments  of  the function to be
        compiled.   Thus,   be   careful   which  methods  you  annotate  with
        [10XCAP_JIT_RESOLVE_FUNCTION[110X. In particular, the CAP categories of objects
        and  morphisms  appearing  during the execution must be independent of
        the JIT arguments.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere are also additional strong requirements:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOnly  assignments  to  local  variables,  if/elif/else statements, and
        return statements are allowed as statements in functions.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAll  branches  of  any  given  if/elif/else  statement must end with a
        return statement or the assignment to the same local variable.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  statements  must  always  have  an  else  statement, except if all
        branches  end  with  a  return  statement.  In  the  latter  case, the
        statements  following  the  if statement are automatically put into an
        else statement.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YNested if/elif/else statements are not allowed.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFunction arguments or local variables must not be called [10XRETURN_VALUE[110X,
        as this name is used internally.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YLocal  variables must be assigned at most once (this includes function
        arguments,  which are assigned at least once, namely when the function
        is  called).  An  exception  is made for "rapid reassignments": if the
        same  variable is assigned and then reassigned immediately in the next
        statement, this only counts as a single assignment.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSince the compiler might change the order of statements, checking if a
        local variable (or list entry etc.) is bound is not safe.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFor performance optimizations, the compiler might move expressions out
        of  if/else  statements,  e.g.  if  they  occur  inside a (potentially
        expensive)  [10XList[110X  call.  Thus,  code  inside  if/else  statements must
        execute without error even if moved outside of the if/else statement.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  is  an  additional  weak  requirement when passing JIT arguments: The
  compiler mainly optimizes the code paths covered when executing the function
  with the JIT arguments. Thus, the JIT arguments should represent a "generic"
  call,  i.e.,  they should not run into edge cases which do not happen with a
  "generic"  call.  Still, the execution using JIT arguments should be fast to
  improve compilation times.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAdditionally,  there  is  no  detection  for  recursive  function  calls, so
  resolving such a function call leads to an infinite loop.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YActivating the compiler[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou  can  activate  the compiler by passing the option [10Xenable_compilation[110X to
  any  category  constructor.  If [10Xenable_compilation[110X is set to [10Xtrue[110X, any basic
  operation   will   be   compiled   when   called  for  the  first  time.  If
  [10Xenable_compilation[110X is a list of strings, compilation will only happen if the
  function name of the basic operation appears in this list.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.5 [33X[0;0YGiving hints to the compiler[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou can give hints to the compiler to improve the result of the compilation.
  Compiler    hints    are    attached    to    the    category    by   making
  [10Xcategory!.compiler_hints[110X a record with one or more of the following keys:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[10Xcategory_attribute_names[110X:  a  list  of  names  of  attributes  of  the
        category. If a global variable in the compiled code has the same value
        as one of the given attributes of the category, the global variable is
        replaced  by the attribute getter applied to the category. Background:
        During  the  compilation, the compiler resolves attributes occuring in
        the    code    and    stores   them   in   global   variables   called
        [10XCAP_JIT_INTERNAL_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_n[110X  (for  integers [10Xn[110X starting from 1).
        If  these  variables  cannot  be  replaced, the resulting code is only
        valid in the current session.[133X

        [10Xsource_attribute_getter_name[110X,     and     [10Xrange_attribute_getter_name[110X.
        Replaces  the  attribute  [10Xobject_attribute_name[110X  of  the source (resp.

        [10Xrange_attribute_getter_name[110X)      applied     to     the     attribute
        [10Xmorphism_attribute_name[110X  of  the  morphism. Can be used if objects and
        morphisms  can be easily created from the morphism datum anyway. Note:
        Some simple expressions like integers are NOT replaced.[133X

  a kernel function, it is returned unchanged). The list of arguments [3Xjit_args[103X
  is  used  to  infer  the types of variables. If [3Xjit_args[103X is shorter than the
  number  of  arguments  accepted  by  [3Xfunc[103X, all steps which require knowledge
  about  the types of variables are skipped. If the first entry of [3Xjit_args[103X is
  a  CAP  category, this category is used to get the type information required
  to resolve CAP operations.[133X

  [30X    [33X[0;6YQ: Why is my function not resolved?[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA:        The        function        might        be        listed        in
  [10XCAP_JIT_NON_RESOLVABLE_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_NAMES[110X  or  it  might  be  missing  an
  annotation   with   the  pragma  [10XCAP_JIT_RESOLVE_FUNCTION[110X.  Additionally,  a
  function can only be resolved if it appears as a global variable in the tree
  during  the  resolving  phase  of  the  compilation.  That  is,  it  must be
  referenced  from  a  global  variable from the beginning on, or after global
  variables  are  resolved by [2XCapJitResolvedGlobalVariables[102X ([14X2.5-16[114X). Possibly
  you have adapt [2XCapJitResolvedGlobalVariables[102X ([14X2.5-16[114X) to your setting.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YQ: Why is my operation not resolved?[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA:  The operation might be listed in [10XCAP_JIT_NON_RESOLVABLE_OPERATION_NAMES[110X.
  If  the  operation  is  not  a  CAP  operation  and  if there are no methods
  installed   for   the   operation   via   [10XInstallMethodForCompilerForCAP[110X  or
  [10XInstallOtherMethodForCompilerForCAP[110X,  the  compiler  must be able to get the
  arguments  of  the  call  of  the operation from the JIT arguments. Then the
  rules in the description of [2XCapJitResolvedOperations[102X ([14X2.5-17[114X) apply.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YQ: Why do I get the error "cannot find iteration key"?[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA:  For  each  syntax  tree  node  type, the tree iterator has to know which
  record  names  it  should  use  for continuing the iteration. Please add the
  missing keys to [10XCAP_INTERNAL_JIT_ITERATION_KEYS[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YQ:  Why  do  I  get  the  error  "tree  has no kown type" when calling
        [2XCapJitPrettyPrintSyntaxTree[102X ([14X2.4-3[114X)?[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA:  [2XCapJitPrettyPrintSyntaxTree[102X  ([14X2.4-3[114X)  needs  to handle every syntax tree
  node    type    separately.    Please    add    the    missing    type    to

  [30X    [33X[0;6YQ:  Why  is  do  I get the error "a local variable with name <name> is
        assigned  more than once (not as a part of a rapid reassignment), this
        is not supported"?[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA:  For reasons of correctness, variables cannot be inlined if a variable is
  assigned  more  than  once in the body of a function (this includes function
  arguments  which  are  assigned  at  least once, namely when the function is
  called).  An  exception  is  made  for  "rapid  reassignments":  if the same
  variable  is assigned and then reassigned immediately in the next statement,
  this only counts as a single assignment.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YQ: Why do I get one of the following errors: "tree includes statements
        or  expressions  which indicate possible side effects", "tree contains
        an  assignment  of a higher variable with initial name <name>, this is
        not  supported",  or  "tree contains for loop over non-local variable,
        this is not supported" ?[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA:  We  can  only drop unused variables, inline variables, etc. if we assume
  that  the  code  contains  no side effects. Statements like STAT_PROCCALL or
  assignment to higher variables cause (or at least indicate) side effects, so
  continuing with the compilation would probably not lead to a correct result.[133X
