# This script applies three rules to all coverage*.json files below the current working directory:
# a) Remove all coverage information of files not below the current working directory
#    (this technically includes "tst/testall.g" because it is not referenced by an absolute path).
# b) Strip the current working directory from the paths of files below the current working directory.
# c) Ignore lines with one of the "COVERAGE_IGNORE_..." annotations (see below).
