  [33X[0;0YThis  section  describes  the  overall  structure  of  Add-functions and the
  functions installed by them.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.1 [33X[0;0YFunctions Installed by Add[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAdd functions (up to some exceptions) have the following syntax[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDeclareOperation( "AddSomeFunc", [ IsCapCategory, IsList, IsInt ] );[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   first   argument   is  the  category  to  which  some  function  (e.g.
  KernelObject)  is  added, the second is a list containing pairs of functions
  and  additional  filters  for  the  arguments,  (e.g.  if  one argument is a
  morphism,  an  additional  filter  could  be IsMomomorphism). The third is a
  weight  which will then be the weight for SomeFunc. This is described later.
  If  only  one  function  is to be installed, the list can be replaced by the
  function.  Via  InstallMethod, CAP installs the given function(s) as methods
  for  the  install  name  of  SomeFunc,  as listed in the MethodRecord. If no
  install name is given, the name SomeFunc is used.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll installed methods follow the following steps, described below:[133X

  [30X    [33X[0;6YAddfunction[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEvery  other  part,  except  from  function,  does  only  depend on the name
  SomeFunc. We now explain the steps in detail.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YRedirect  function:  The  redirect is used to redirect the computation
        from the given functions to some other symbol. If there is for example
        a  with  given  method  for some universal property, and the universal
        object  is already computed, the redirect function might detect such a
        thing,  calls  the  with  given operation with the universal object as
        additional  argument  and  then  returns  the  value.  In general, the
        redirect  can  be  an  arbitrary  function. It is called with the same
        arguments  as  the  operation  SomeFunc itself and can return an array
        containing  [ true, something ], which will cause the installed method
        to  simply return the object something, or [ false ]. If the output is
        false,  the  computation  will  continue  with  the  step Prefunction.
        Additionally,  for  every category and every name like SomeFunc, there
        is  a  boolean,  stored in the categorys redirects component under the
        name  of  SomeFunc, which, when it is false, will prevent the redirect
        function from being executed.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPrefunction:  The  prefunction  should  be used for error handling and
        soft  checks  of  the  sanity  of  the  input  to  SomeFunc  (e.g. for
        KernelLift  it  should  check  wether range and source of the morphims
        coincide).  Generally, the prefunction is defined in the method record
        and only depend on the name SomeFunc. It is called with the same input
        as  the  function  itself,  and  should  return either [ true ], which
        continues  the  computation, or [ false, "message" ], which will cause
        an error with message "message" and some additional information.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFunction:  This  will  launch  the function(s) given as arguments. The
        result  should  be as specified in the type of SomeFunc. The resulting
        object is now named the result.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YLogic:  For every function, some logical todos can be implemented in a
        logic texfile for the category. If there is some logic written down in
        a  file  belonging  to  the  category,  or  belonging  to some type of
        category.  Please  see  the  description of logic for more details. If
        there  is  some  logic  and  some predicate relations for the function
        SomeFunc, it is installed in this step for the result.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPostfunction:  The  postfunction  called  with  the  arguments  of the
        function  and  the  result. It can be an arbitrary function doing some
        cosmetics.  If  for example SomeFunc is KernelEmbeddingedding, it will
        set the KernelObject of the input morphism to result. The postfunction
        is  also taken from the method record and does only depend on the name
        SomeFunc.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAddfunction:  If  the  result  is  a category cell, it is added to the
        category for which the function was installed.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.2 [33X[0;0YAdd Method[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YExcept  from  installing  a  new method for the name SomeFunc, an Add method
  does  slightly  more.  Every Add method has the same structure. The steps in
  the Add method are as follows:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWeight check: If the current weight of the operation is lower than the
        given  weight  of the new functions, then the add function returns and
        installs nothing.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOption  check:  There  are  two possible options for every add method:
        SetPrimitive and IsDerivation.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YSetPrimitive  should  be  a  boolean,  the  default  is true. If
              SetPrimitive  is  false,  then the current call of this add will
              not set the installed function to be primitive. This is used for
              derivations.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YIsDerivation  should  be  a  boolean, default is false. If it is
              true,  the  add  method  assumes  that  the  given function is a
              derivation and does not try to install a corresponding pair (See
              below).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YStandard weight: If the weight parameter is -1, the Standard weight is
        assumed, which is 100.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YChecking for pairs: If the function is not a with given operation, has
        a corresponding with given or is a with given, and is newly installed,
        i.e.  the  current  installation  weight  which  is  given  to the add
        function  is  less than the current weight, the add method is going to
        install  a  corresponding  pair  function,  i.e.  a  function  for the
        corresponding  with  or  without  given method, which redirects to the
        currently  installed  functions.  It also deactivates the redirect for
        this  function.  Note that the pair install is only done for primitive
        functions, and if the current weight is higher than the given weight.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YCan compute: Set the corresponding can compute of the category to true[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YInstall  methods:  Decide on the methods used to install the function.
        Check                  wether                  InstallMethodWithCache,
        InstallMethodWithToDoForIsWellDefined,  both,  or simply InstallMethod
        is used. This is decided by the ToDo and the caching flags.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YInstallation: Next, the method to install the functions is created. It
        creates  the  correct filter list, by merging the standard filters for
        the  operation  with  the  particular filters for the given functions,
        then installs the method as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSetPrimitive:  If  the  set  primitive  flag  is  true,  it  is set as
        primitive in the weight list of the category.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPair  install:  If there is a function pair, as described above, it is
        installed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter calling an add method, the corresponding Operation is availible in the
  category.  Also, some derivations, which are triggered by the setting of the
  primitive value, might be availible.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.3 [33X[0;0YInstallAdd Function[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlmost   all   Add   methods   in  the  CAP  kernel  are  installed  by  the
  CapInternalInstallAdd  operation.  The  definition  of  this  function is as
  follows:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDeclareOperation( "CapInternalInstallAdd", [ IsRecord ] );[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe record can have the following components, used as described:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yfunction_name:  The  name  of  the  function.  This  does  not have to
        coincide  with  the  installation  name. It is used for the derivation
        weight.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yinstallation_name  (optional):  A  string  which  is  the  name of the
        operation  for  which  the  functions  given  to  the  Add  method are
        installed as methods.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ypre_function  (optional):  A function which is used as the prefunction
        of the installed methods, as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yredirect_function (optional): A function which is used as the redirect
        function of the installed methods, as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ypost_function (optional): A function which is used as the postfunction
        of the installed methods, as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yfilter_list:  A  list  containing  the  basic  filters for the methods
        installed  by  the  add  methods. Possible are filters, or the strings
        category, object, morphism, or twocell, which will then be replaced at
        the  time  the  add method is called with the corresponding filters of
        the category.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ywell_defined_todo  (optional): A boolean, default value is true, which
        states  wether there should be to do list entries which propagate well
        definedness  from  the input of the installed methods to their output.
        Please  note  that  true only makes sense if at least one argument and
        the output of the installed method is a cell.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ycache_name  (optional):  The  name  of the cache which is used for the
        installed  methods.  If  no  cache  name is given, the caching for the
        operation is deactivated completely.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yargument_list  (optional):  A  list containing integers, which defines
        which  arguments  should  be  used  for the additional functions, (e.g
        redirect, pre, ...). This is important for the Op method contructions.
        If no argument list is given, all arguments are used. Please note that
        if you have a method selection argument for your function, you need to
        give  the  argument_list  to  explicitly  state  which argument is the
        method selection argument.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yreturn_type  (optional):  The  return type can be object, morphism, or
        twocell.  If  it is one of those, the correct add function (see above)
        is  used for the result of the computation. Otherwise, no add function
        is used after all.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yis_with_given:  Boolean,  marks  wether  the  function  which is to be
        installed a with given function or not.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ywith_given_without_given_name_pair   (optional):   If   the  currently
        installed operation has a corresponding with given operation or is the
        with  given  of another operation, the names of both should be in this
        list.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yfunctorial  (optional):  If  an  object has a corresponding functorial
        function,  e.g.,  KernelObject and KernelObjectFunctorial, the name of
        the functorial is stored as a string.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUsing  all  those  entries, the operation CapInternalInstallAdd installs add
  methods  as  described  above.  It first provides a sanity check for all the
  entries  described,  then  installs  the  Add method in 4 ways, with list or

  [33X[0;0YThe  function  CAP_INTERNAL_INSTALL_ALL_ADDS does not take any arguments, it
  is     an     auxiliary     function     which     iterates     over     the
  CAP_INTERNAL_METHOD_NAME_RECORD   and   calls,  after  some  cosmetics,  the
  CapInternalInstallAdd  with the corresponding method record entry. The steps
  below are performed for every entry of the method record:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YNo  install check: If the no_install component in the record is set to
        true,  the  loop  continues  with  the  next  entry,  since  this flag
        indicates that there should be no add function for this operation.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YCache  check:  If  there  is  no cache_name, set it to the name of the
        method record entry.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFunction name: Set the component function_name to the entry name.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YRedirect:  Since  the  redirect  function  needs  the category to work
        correctly,  the given redirects in the method records are packed up to
        discard the last argument, which is the category.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yarg_list:  Next,  an  argument  list for redirect and post function is
        created, by looking at the filter list in the record. If the first one
        is a list, the first and the last (method selection argument) is used,
        otherwise only the first.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWithGiven  special  case:  If the current entry belongs to a WithGiven
        operation,  the  with_given_without_given_name_pair  is  set, the with
        given  flag  is  set  to true, and the CapInternalInstallAdd is called
        with the record. The loop then continues.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YNon  universal  object  special case: If the Operation does not have a
        universal  type,  i.e.  does  not  belong to a universal construction,
        CapInternalInstallAdd  is  called  with  the  record.  The  loop  then
        continues.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YPlease  note  that  we  are now in the case where the operation belongs to a

        and  then  used  as  above. Otherwise, the argument_list is set to all
        arguments.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  the  Operation  constructs a universal object, the postfunction is

  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  the  Operation  constructs  a  universal morphism, the redirect is
