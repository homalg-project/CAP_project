  [33X[0;0YThis  section  describes  the  overall  structure  of  Add-functions and the
  functions installed by them.[133X
  
  
  [1X7.1 [33X[0;0YFunctions Installed by Add[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAdd functions have the following syntax:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Code  [32X[104X
    [4XDeclareOperation( "AddSomeFunc",[104X
    [4X                  [ IsCapCategory, IsList, IsInt ] );[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   first   argument   is  the  category  to  which  some  function  (e.g.
  [10XKernelObject[110X)  is  added, the second is a list containing pairs of functions
  and  additional  filters  for  the  arguments,  (e.g.  if  one argument is a
  morphism,  an  additional  filter  could be [10XIsMomomorphism[110X). The third is an
  optional  weight  which will then be the weight for [10XSomeFunc[110X (default value:
  100).  This is described later. If only one function is to be installed, the
  list  can be replaced by the function. CAP installs the given function(s) as
  methods for [10XSomeFunc[110X (resp. [10XSomeFuncOp[110X if [10XSomeFunc[110X is not an operation).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll installed methods follow the following steps, described below:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YRedirect function[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPrefunction[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFunction[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YLogic[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPostfunction[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAddfunction[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEvery  other  part,  except  from  function,  does  only  depend on the name
  [10XSomeFunc[110X. We now explain the steps in detail.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YRedirect  function:  The  redirect is used to redirect the computation
        from the given functions to some other symbol. If there is for example
        a  with  given  method  for some universal property, and the universal
        object  is already computed, the redirect function might detect such a
        thing,  calls  the  with  given operation with the universal object as
        additional  argument  and  then  returns  the  value.  In general, the
        redirect  can  be  an  arbitrary  function. It is called with the same
        arguments  as  the  operation  [10XSomeFunc[110X itself and can return an array
        containing  [10X[ true, something ][110X, which will cause the installed method
        to  simply return the object [10Xsomething[110X, or [10X[ false ][110X. If the output is
        [10Xfalse[110X, the computation will continue with the step Prefunction.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPrefunction:  The  prefunction  should  be used for error handling and
        plausibility  checks  of the input to [10XSomeFunc[110X (e.g. for [10XKernelLift[110X it
        should  check  wether  range  and  source  of  the morphims coincide).
        Generally,  the  prefunction  is defined in the method record and only
        depends  on the name [10XSomeFunc[110X. It is called with the same input as the
        function  itself,  and  should return either [10X[ true ][110X, which continues
        the  computation,  or  [10X[ false, "message" ][110X, which will cause an error
        with message [10X"message"[110X and some additional information.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFull  prefunction:  The  full prefuction has the same semantics as the
        prefunction,  but can perform additional, very costly checks. They are
        disabled by default.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFunction:  This  will  launch  the function(s) given as arguments. The
        result  should  be as specified in the type of [10XSomeFunc[110X. The resulting
        object is now named the result.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YLogic:  For every function, some logical todos can be implemented in a
        logic texfile for the category. If there is some logic written down in
        a  file  belonging  to  the  category,  or  belonging  to some type of
        category.  Please  see  the  description of logic for more details. If
        there  is  some  logic  and  some predicate relations for the function
        [10XSomeFunc[110X, it is installed in this step for the result.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPostfunction:  The  postfunction  called  with  the  arguments  of the
        function  and  the  result. It can be an arbitrary function doing some
        cosmetics. If for example [10XSomeFunc[110X is [10XKernelEmbedding[110X, it will set the
        [10XKernelObject[110X of the input morphism to result. The postfunction is also
        taken  from  the  method  record  and  does  only  depend  on the name
        [10XSomeFunc[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAddfunction:  If  the  result  is  a category cell, it is added to the
        category  for  which  the  function was installed. This is disabled by
        default  and  can  be  enabled  via  [2XEnableAddForCategoricalOperations[102X
        ([14X1.11-1[114X).[133X
  
  
  [1X7.2 [33X[0;0YAdd Method[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YExcept  from  installing  a  new method for the name [10XSomeFunc[110X, an Add method
  does  slightly  more.  Every Add method has the same structure. The steps in
  the Add method are as follows:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDefault  weight:  If the weight parameter is -1, the default weight is
        assumed, which is 100.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWeight check: If the current weight of the operation is lower than the
        given  weight  of the new functions, then the add function returns and
        installs nothing.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YInstallation: Next, the method to install the functions is created. It
        creates  the  correct filter list, by merging the standard filters for
        the  operation  with  the  particular filters for the given functions,
        then installs the method as described above.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter calling an add method, the corresponding operation is available in the
  category.  Also, some derivations, which are triggered by the setting of the
  primitive value, might be available.[133X
  
  
  [1X7.3 [33X[0;0YInstallAdd Function[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlmost   all   Add   methods   in  the  CAP  kernel  are  installed  by  the
  [10XCapInternalInstallAdd[110X  operation.  The  definition  of  this  function is as
  follows:[133X

    [4XDeclareOperation( "CapInternalInstallAdd",[104X
    [4X                  [ IsRecord ] );[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  record  can  have the following components, most of which can be set in
  the method name record, used as described:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yfunction_name:  The  name  of  the  function.  This  does  not have to
        coincide  with  the  installation  name. It is used for the derivation
        weight.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yinstallation_name  (optional):  A  string  which  is  the  name of the
        operation  for  which  the  functions  given  to  the  Add  method are
        installed as methods.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ypre_function  (optional):  A function which is used as the prefunction
        of the installed methods, as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ypre_function_full  (optional):  A  function  which is used as the full
        prefunction of the installed methods, as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yredirect_function (optional): A function which is used as the redirect
        function of the installed methods, as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ypost_function (optional): A function which is used as the postfunction
        of the installed methods, as described above.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yfilter_list:  A  list  containing  the  basic  filters for the methods
        installed  by  the  add  methods. Possible entries are filters, or the
        strings listed below, which will be replaced by appropriate filters at
        the time the add method is called. The first entry of [10Xfilter_list[110X must
        be  the  string  [10Xcategory[110X.  If  the  category can be inferred from the
        remaining  arguments, a convenience method without the category as the
        first  argument is installed automatically. Additionally, the category
        is   not   passed   to   primitively   added   functions,   except  if
        [10Xcategory!.category_as_first_argument[110X   is   set  to  [10Xtrue[110X  (this  will
        probably change to be the default in the future).[133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that [3Xfunc[103X is not handled by the CAP caching mechanism and that the use
  of  prepare  functions  is incompatible with [10XWithGiven[110X operations. Thus, one

  [33X[0;0YAdds  a  prepare  function to the list of CAP's prepare functions. The first
  argument is the prepare function itself. It should always be a function that
  takes a category and a function and returns a function. The argument [3Xname[103X is
  the    name    of    the    prepare    function,    which    is    used   in
  [10XCAPOperationPrepareFunction[110X.  The  argument  [3Xdoc_string[103X  should  be  a short
  string describing the functions. The optional argument [3Xprecondition_list[103X can
  describe  preconditions  for  the  prepare  function  to  work, i.e., if the
  category  does  need to have PreCompose computable. This information is also
  recovered   automatically   from   the   prepare  function  itself,  so  the
  [3Xprecondition_list[103X is only necessary if the function needed is not explicitly
